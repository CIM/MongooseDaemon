/**
 `MongooseDaemon` is an objective C wrapper around the embedable `mongoose` http server for iOS or Mac development. It is ideal for both embedded http services as well as simply debugging your iOS or Mac applications file structure. `MongooseDaemon` is offered under a BSD style license.
 
 `Mongoose` is a lightweight embedable http server written by Sergey Lyubka and offered under a BSD style license. More information on mongoose can be found at the [project's github](https://github.com/valenok/mongoose).
 
 ##Usage
 
 Clone the project directory and add submodules. Add the following files to your Xcode project:
 
 - `MongooseDaemon.h|.m`
 - `mongoose/mongoose.h|.c`
 
 Then you can start it within one of your classes to provide http access to your iOS or Mac application.
 
 For example, to start `MongooseDaemon` when your application starts on port 8888:
 
 Add the following to `MyAppDelegate.m`:
 
     #import "MongooseDaemon.h"
 
     @implementation MyAppDelegate {
         MongooseDaemon    *mongooseDaemon;
     }
 
     - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {
         mongooseDaemon = [[MongooseDaemon alloc] init];
         mongooseDaemon.listeningPort = 8888;
         [mongooseDaemon start];
     }
     - (void)dealloc {
         [mongooseDaemon stop];
     }
 
 And that's it!
 
 ##TODO
 
 - Add support for more of mongoose's options.
 - Implement mongoose callbacks and fire delegate/notifications.
